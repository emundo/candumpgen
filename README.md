## Installation ##

Install the latest release using pip (``pip install candumpgen``) or manually from source by running ``pip install .`` (preferred) or ``python setup.py install`` in the cloned repository. Doing so installs both the library for programmatic usage and an executable called `candumpgen`. Use `candumpgen --help` for usage information.
